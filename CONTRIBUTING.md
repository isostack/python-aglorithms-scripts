- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repository and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!
7. Always add a `README` and/or `requirements.txt` to your added code.

## Any contributions you make will be under the GNU Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under a license that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
[This is an example](http://stackoverflow.com/q/12488905/180626) of a bug report I wrote, and I think it's not a bad model. Here's [another example from Craig Hockenberry](http://www.openradar.me/11905408), an app developer whom I greatly respect.


## Use a Consistent Coding Style
You can check [here](https://docs.python-guide.org/writing/style/) for more information about a good coding style. It's important to respect and follow it up to keep good practices. If it's difficult for you please, take in consideration use `flake8`

## License
