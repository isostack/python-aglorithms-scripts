# Python Algorithms/Scripts

### Description

Welcome on board fellow developer, this repo is a collection of various programming algorithms written in python language with litle lines of code.

The python language's simple syntax makes it very easy to implement algorithms and understand what is going in a program and this collection shows how simple and easy the python syntax is.

You can contribute by adding any algorithms script, also written in Python, to the collection of algorithms, which you think would be amazing for other people to see and use in thier various programs.
