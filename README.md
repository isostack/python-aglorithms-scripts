# Simple Syntax - Python

### Description

Welcome on board fellow developer, this repo is a collection of various programming algorithms written in python language with litle lines of code.

The python language's simple syntax makes it very easy to implement algorithms and understand what is going in a program and this collection shows how simple and easy the python syntax is.

You can contribute by adding any algorithms script, also written in Python, to the collection of algorithms, which you think would be amazing for other people to see and use in thier various programs.

### How to install and run

If you want to run any of the python scripts you can clone the project unto your local machine and run the python files 
Developers can use, modify and perfect these algorithms and push them back into the project back here
